The `src/services/api/` directory serves as the central hub for all AI interactions, abstracting the complexities of API calls and prompt engineering.

## 2. Core AI Service Utilities (`src/services/api/utils.ts`)

This module provides foundational utilities that are crucial for interacting with various AI models and managing the AI workflow.

*   **`getApiConfig(model: Model)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Dynamically selects the correct API key, base URL, and HTTP headers based on the chosen AI model (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, Grok). It also retrieves the maximum token limit for the selected model.
    *   **Mechanism:** Reads API keys from environment variables (`VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `VITE_GROK_API_KEY`).
    *   **Relevance for New App:** Essential for managing multiple AI providers and ensuring secure API key handling.

*   **`handleApiResponse<T>(response: Response)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Standardizes error handling and JSON parsing for all AI API responses. It attempts to clean responses that might be wrapped in Markdown code blocks (` ```json `).
    *   **Mechanism:** Checks `response.ok` status, reads the response body as text, and then attempts to parse it as JSON. Includes robust `try-catch` blocks for parsing errors.
    *   **Relevance for New App:** Crucial for reliable data processing and user-friendly error messages when dealing with potentially inconsistent AI outputs.

*   **`storePrompts(systemPrompt: string, userPrompt: string)` / `getLastPrompts()`:**

## 10. How to Generate a New AI-Powered App: General Instructions

Based on the PimpMyCopy architecture, here's a generalized approach to building a new AI-powered application:

### 10.1. Define Your Core AI Use Cases

*   Clearly identify what problems you want AI to solve in your app. Is it text generation, summarization, classification, data extraction, image generation, etc.?
*   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable AI functions.

### 10.2. Select Appropriate AI Models

*   Research and choose AI models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT series, DeepSeek, Grok, Claude, custom models) that best fit your use case in terms of quality, speed, cost, and specific capabilities (e.g., JSON mode, function calling).
*   Consider having multiple models for different tasks or user tiers.

### 10.3. Design Your User Interface (UI) and Input Structure

*   Determine what information your application needs from the user to effectively guide the AI.
*   Design intuitive forms and input fields that collect this information.
*   Consider features like suggestion buttons (`SuggestionButton.tsx`) to assist users in providing good inputs.

### 10.4. Master Prompt Engineering

This is the most critical step for effective AI integration.

*   **System Prompt:** Define the AI's persona, role, and strict rules for its behavior and output format. Be extremely precise and explicit about constraints (e.g., "You are an expert copywriter," "Respond ONLY in JSON," "NEVER exceed X characters").
*   **User Prompt:** Dynamically construct the user prompt by injecting all relevant user inputs from your UI. Ensure the prompt is clear, concise, and provides sufficient context for the AI to perform its task.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Test your prompts extensively, analyze AI outputs, and refine your prompts based on the results. Expect to spend significant time here.

### 10.5. Implement Robust AI API Interaction

*   Create a dedicated API service layer (like `src/services/api/`) to centralize all AI calls.
*   Implement functions for each AI task (e.g., `generateCopy`, `getSuggestions`).
*   Use a utility for managing API configurations (`getApiConfig`) if using multiple models/providers.
*   Implement standardized error handling and response parsing (`handleApiResponse`) to ensure reliability.

### 10.6. Process and Validate AI Output

*   **Parsing:** Be prepared for AI to sometimes deviate from the requested output format. Implement robust parsing logic (e.g., `try-catch` for JSON parsing, regex for specific patterns).
*   **Validation:** Validate the AI's output against your application's requirements (e.g., word count, character limits, content safety, data types).
*   **Refinement/Correction:** For critical constraints (like exact word count), implement iterative refinement loops (like `contentRefinement.ts`) where the AI is prompted to correct its own output until it meets the criteria.

### 10.7. Integrate AI with Your UI

*   **Display Inputs:** Clearly show users what information is being sent to the AI.
*   **Show Progress:** Provide real-time feedback on AI processing (e.g., loading spinners, progress messages).
*   **Present Outputs:** Display AI-generated content in an intuitive and organized manner. Consider interactive elements (like `GeneratedCopyCard.tsx`) that allow users to further manipulate or evaluate the output.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Allow users to provide feedback on AI output, trigger variations, or refine their initial inputs.

### 10.8. Implement Backend Services and Data Management

*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure your application and control access to AI features (e.g., using Supabase Auth and Row Level Security).
*   **Data Storage:** Store user data, AI inputs, and AI outputs in a database (e.g., Supabase PostgreSQL) for persistence, history, and analytics.
*   **Usage Tracking:** Crucially, track every AI API call, including tokens consumed, cost, and the user who initiated it. This is essential for monitoring, billing, and understanding feature usage.

### 10.9. Consider Scalability, Performance, and Security

*   **Rate Limits:** Be aware of AI provider rate limits and implement strategies to handle them (e.g., retries with exponential backoff).
*   **Latency:** Optimize your prompts and UI to minimize perceived latency.
*   **API Key Security:** Never expose API keys on the frontend. Use backend services or secure environment variables.
*   **Data Privacy:** Understand how AI providers handle your data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

## 11. Key Architectural Patterns from PimpMyCopy

### 11.1. Modular AI Service Architecture

*   Each AI function is isolated in its own module, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and extend.
*   All modules share common utilities (`utils.ts`, `tokenTracking.ts`) to ensure consistency.

### 11.2. Progressive Enhancement

*   The application provides a base set of AI features and allows users to selectively enable additional capabilities (scoring, SEO metadata, voice styling).
*   This approach keeps the initial user experience simple while offering advanced features to power users.

### 11.3. Real-time Feedback and Transparency

*   Progress callbacks throughout AI operations keep users informed of what's happening.
*   Admin features like prompt display provide full transparency into AI interactions.
*   Quality scores and evaluations give users confidence in the AI's output.

### 11.4. Iterative Refinement

*   The application recognizes that AI output may not be perfect on the first attempt and implements systems for iterative improvement (especially for word count adherence).
*   Multiple AI calls in sequence (generate → evaluate → refine → score) create a more reliable and high-quality output.

### 11.5. Card-Based Output Management

*   Each piece of AI-generated content is treated as an independent entity (card) with its own metadata, actions, and lifecycle.
*   This approach allows for granular control and selective enhancement without affecting other content pieces.

### 11.6. Comprehensive State Management

*   The `FormState` object captures all user inputs and AI generation settings, enabling features like session restoration, template creation, and consistent reproduction of results.
*   State is persisted to the database, allowing users to resume work and maintain a history of their AI interactions.

## 12. Specific Implementation Details for AI Integration

### 12.1. Prompt Engineering Best Practices (Based on PimpMyCopy)

*   **Be Explicit About Output Format:** Always specify whether you want plain text, JSON, HTML, etc. Include examples of the expected structure.
*   **Enforce Constraints Rigorously:** For critical requirements (word count, character limits), use CAPITAL LETTERS, repetition, and threats of "COMPLETE FAILURE" to ensure the AI takes them seriously.
*   **Provide Comprehensive Context:** Include all relevant user inputs in the prompt. Don't assume the AI can infer missing information.
*   **Use Role-Playing:** Define the AI's role clearly (e.g., "expert copywriter," "marketing advisor") to influence its perspective and expertise.
*   **Handle Multiple Output Formats:** Be prepared for the AI to return structured content (JSON objects with headlines and sections) or plain text, and handle both cases gracefully.

### 12.2. Error Handling and Resilience

*   **Graceful Degradation:** If AI calls fail, provide meaningful error messages and alternative options rather than breaking the entire workflow.
*   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures (network issues, rate limits).
*   **Fallback Options:** Consider providing fallback content or alternative AI models if the primary choice fails.

### 12.3. User Experience (UX) Considerations

*   **Progress Indicators:** AI operations can take time. Always provide progress feedback and allow users to cancel operations.
*   **Incremental Results:** Where possible, show intermediate results rather than waiting for everything to complete.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to control AI parameters (model selection, output length, style) rather than hiding these choices.
*   **Transparency:** Provide ways for users (especially admins) to inspect the AI's inputs and understand how outputs were generated.

### 12.4. Cost Management

*   **Token Tracking:** Implement comprehensive token usage tracking for every AI call. This data is crucial for understanding costs and optimizing usage.
*   **Model Selection:** Offer different AI models with different cost profiles, allowing users to balance quality and cost.
*   **User Limits:** Implement user-specific token limits and subscription management.
*   **Efficiency Optimization:** Minimize unnecessary AI calls by caching results, using smaller models for simple tasks, and optimizing prompt length.

## 13. Technical Stack for AI Integration

Based on PimpMyCopy's implementation:

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for type safety and robust state management.
*   **Backend:** Supabase for database, authentication, and edge functions.
*   **AI Models:** Multiple providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, xAI/Grok) for different capabilities and cost profiles.
*   **State Management:** React hooks and context for managing complex form state and AI operation status.
*   **UI Components:** Reusable components for AI-related functionality (suggestion buttons, progress indicators, result cards).

## 14. Security and Privacy Considerations

*   **API Key Management:** Never expose AI provider API keys on the frontend. Use environment variables and backend services.
*   **Data Handling:** Be transparent about how user data is processed by AI models and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Access Control:** Implement proper authentication and authorization before allowing AI operations.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement application-level rate limiting to prevent abuse and unexpected costs.

## 15. Conclusion

PimpMyCopy demonstrates a sophisticated approach to AI integration that goes beyond simple text generation. It shows how to:

*   Create a modular, maintainable architecture for AI services
*   Implement complex prompt engineering for reliable outputs
*   Handle the inherent unpredictability of AI responses
*   Provide granular user control over AI behavior
*   Integrate multiple AI capabilities into a cohesive user experience
*   Manage costs and track usage effectively
*   Maintain transparency and debugging capabilities

This architecture can serve as a blueprint for any application that needs to integrate multiple AI capabilities in a user-friendly, reliable, and cost-effective manner. The key is to treat AI as a powerful but imperfect tool that requires careful orchestration, robust error handling, and iterative refinement to deliver production-quality results.
