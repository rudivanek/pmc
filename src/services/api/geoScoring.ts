CONTENT TO EVALUATE:
"""
${textContent}

SCORING CRITERIA (Total possible: 100 points):

1. **Direct Answer Clarity** (20 points max)
   - Does the content start with a concise, clear answer or summary?
   - Is there a TL;DR or executive summary at the beginning?
   - Can AI assistants easily extract the main answer?

2. **Scannable Structure** (15 points max)
   - Are there bullet points, short paragraphs, and clear subheadings?
   - Is the content easy to scan and digest quickly?
   - Are there H2/H3 headings that break up the content?

3. **Question-Based Headings** (10 points max)
   - Are headings phrased as questions that AI assistants can index?
   - Do headings match common user queries?
   - Would an AI assistant surface these headings as relevant answers?

4. **Local Relevance or GEO Markers** (20 points max)
   - Does the content mention specific locations, regions, or geographical markers?
   - Are there phrases useful for local AI and search discovery?
   - Examples: "in Mexico", "Querétaro", "serving clients across LATAM", etc.
   - Note: This criterion gets full points if content is intentionally global/location-neutral

5. **Quote-Friendly Sentences** (15 points max)
   - Are there short, clear sentences that AI can easily quote?
   - Does the content have standalone statements that make sense out of context?
   - Are key points expressed in quotable, memorable phrases?

6. **Authority Signals** (10 points max)
   - Are examples, statistics, or credentials mentioned?
   - Does the content include social proof or expertise indicators?
   - Are there specific results, numbers, or case studies mentioned?

7. **Optional TL;DR / Answer Box** (10 points max)
   - If TL;DR is enabled in the form settings, was it included properly?
   - Does the content have an answer-box style beginning?
   - Is there a quick summary that directly addresses user intent?

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
- Target Language: ${formState.language}
- Content Type: ${formState.tab === 'create' ? 'New Copy' : 'Improved Copy'}
- Page Type: ${formState.pageType || 'Not specified'}
- Target Regions: ${formState.geoRegions || 'Not specified'}
- TL;DR Enabled: ${formState.addTldrSummary ? 'Yes' : 'No'}

IMPORTANT: 
- Calculate scores fairly based on what's actually present in the content
- For "Local Relevance", give full points if content is intentionally global/location-neutral AND well-optimized
- Only include suggestions if overall score is below 80
- Ensure all JSON properties are properly quoted and the response is valid JSON`;
